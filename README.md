Federated Reconstruction for Matrix Factorization : It explores partially local federated learning, where some client parameters are never aggregated on the server. This is useful for models with user-specific parameters (e.g. matrix factorization models) and for training in communication-limited settings. We build on concepts introduced in the Federated Learning for Image Classification tutorial; as in that tutorial, we introduce high-level APIs in tff.learning for federated training and evaluation.
